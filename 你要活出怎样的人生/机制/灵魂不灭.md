# 灵魂不灭

死亡为什么不是终点，因为灵魂不灭。

如果人活着却没有“灵魂”的视角，很容易会被**摧毁。什么是“灵魂”的视角？就是把你的soul和你的physicality分开来看。你的soul是你生命的本质，你的physicality就是与你有关的物质世界的一切，包括你的身体，你的疾病，你的出生，你的家庭，你的成长环境，你的社交圈子。

把这两样分开，是因为这两样有着本质的区别：

——Soul是永恒的，physicality是暂时的；soul是目的，physicality是手段；soul不破不灭，但physicality很脆弱，关系会破裂，环境会恶化，身体会生病，人会死亡。

把暂时的看作是本质，把终要破灭的看作是目的——这是人会犯的最致命的错误。因为你一旦把那个暂时的、终要破灭的physicality的东西当作毕生追求的目标，它一旦毁坏——而它必会毁坏——那么你建立在其上的一切——信心、盼望、喜乐——也就随之烟消云散了。摧毁了physicality就等同于摧毁了你，那么等你面临死亡的时候，因为那是physicality消逝的终极阶段，你的惧怕、空虚和悲伤将是多么的大啊。

只有把暂时的当作永恒的手段，把physicality作为成就soul的途径，physicality本身才能获得它存在的意义。

所以你当然要好好对待身体、要对人友善、要尽力去创造、要实现你的天赋和使命，只不过，they are not end in themselves。你这样做，最终受益的，是你的soul。你在physicality之中所做的一切，虽然短暂和有限，但它们会以正资产的方式持续影响这个世界，而你的soul也会因此得到建造和完善。

下面这段话使用英文书写，这些话用英文说更顺畅。



No one can hurt your soul, either you or anyone else. And no hardship, disease, disability, losses can ever hurt it. Your soul has always been and will always be intact.

Your soul chose to be born to these parents, in this family, at this timing, with this body and with all its potentials and limits, in other words, to become you. Have you ever wondered: Why?

If you haven’t, you should now. You need to ask your soul this question: What’s the purpose? What’s the plan?

Every soul has a purpose and a plan. What does it want to acquire from this life journey? What does it want to experience? What does it want to achieve and learn?

The answer is usually incredibly simple. Sometimes the learning goal is to be patient, sometimes to be humble, sometimes to be brave, to be forgiving and so on.

And sometimes, NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY:

— Sometimes in order to learn, to truly learn a lesson, it might even intentionally choose a difficult life, a humble upbringing, or a disabled body.

Those life challenges, often avoided by most human beings, are eagerly sought out by some older or more mature souls to help with their development in their soul journeys.

You might be surprised by this but if you think about it, it does make sense.

Because the greatest love is most likely to be manifested in such situations. It doesn’t only aid those souls’ own development, it also serves many other people and their development.

Therefore, nothing should come as a surprise, be it fortune or misfortune. They all serve a purpose which is to aid your soul development so that one day all souls can reach a point and be united in love, that is what we call “God”.

Haven’t I told you that “you are gods”?

“Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods” ’?”

Your soul is fine. It will not be hurt unless you commit suicide. Strictly speaking, it’s not that suicide hurting the soul, but that it making the whole planning and preparing a waste. You have to do it all over again.

Knowing that misfortune is not something that is forced upon you, but is something your soul has chosen, and for a purpose, will help you reevaluate your current situation in a new light.

You get angry and desperate because you don’t know where it comes from, why it comes, and why me.

Once you know all is well , all is chosen, and all is for the good, you will find peace.

Now, you may go in peace. 

Live and create!
